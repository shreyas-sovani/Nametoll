# Project Scaffolding

## Purpose

Generate a complete `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/` directory structure for any project. This gives AI agents the context they need to work effectively from the first session — build commands, conventions, quality gates, and session tracking.

## Stack Detection

Before scaffolding, detect the project's tech stack by scanning for manifest files:

| File Found | Stack Detected | Build Tool |
|------------|---------------|------------|
| `tsconfig.json` | TypeScript | `tsc`, `npm`/`yarn`/`pnpm` |
| `package.json` (no tsconfig) | JavaScript | `npm`/`yarn`/`pnpm` |
| `pyproject.toml` | Python | `pip`/`poetry`/`uv` |
| `setup.py` or `requirements.txt` | Python (legacy) | `pip` |
| `Cargo.toml` | Rust | `cargo` |
| `go.mod` | Go | `go` |
| `Makefile` | Check contents | Varies |
| `Dockerfile` | Container | `docker` |

### Detection Steps
1. List files in project root: check for manifest files above
2. If `package.json` exists, read `scripts` to find build/test/lint commands
3. If `pyproject.toml` exists, read `[tool]` sections for configured tools
4. If multiple stacks detected, note all of them (monorepo pattern)

## CLAUDE.md Generation

Use the template from `references/claude-md-template.md` and fill in detected information. **Target: under 200 lines.** Claude Code truncates CLAUDE.md after ~200 lines in the system prompt, so keep it lean.

1. **Project Overview** — read `README.md` or `package.json` description
2. **Build & Run Commands** — detected from manifest `scripts` section (keep 8-10 most-used, add "See [manifest] for full list")
3. **Triggers** — map file patterns to docs/skills for on-demand deep context
4. **Naming Conventions** — select from `references/naming-conventions.md` based on stack. If the table is large, move to `docs/CONVENTIONS.md` and reference from Triggers
5. **Test Command** — detected or ask user
6. **Lint Command** — detected or ask user

### What Gets Pre-Filled
- Core Behaviors (including self-improvement and parallel session rules)
- Triggers section (generated from detected project structure)
- Test-First Development rules
- Git Commit Rules (conventional commits)
- Forbidden Files (.env, credentials, node_modules, etc.)
- Environment Variables rules

### What Needs Detection or User Input
- Project name and description
- Build, test, lint, and dev commands
- Stack-specific naming conventions
- Any custom conventions the user wants

## Triggers Generation

The Triggers section maps file patterns to deeper documentation, enabling on-demand context loading without bloating CLAUDE.md.

### How to Generate Triggers
1. Scan project structure for distinct directories (e.g., `src/`, `lib/`, `tests/`, `docs/`)
2. Identify existing documentation files (`docs/*.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`)
3. Map each source directory to its most relevant doc or skill
4. Include standard patterns: `Dockerfile` → deployment docs, `tests/` → testing docs, new files → conventions

### Example Generated Triggers
```markdown
| File Pattern | Load |
|---|---|
| src/api/* | Read: docs/API.md |
| src/components/* | Read: docs/COMPONENTS.md |
| tests/* | Read: docs/TESTING.md |
| Dockerfile, docker-compose* | Read: docs/DEPLOYMENT.md |
| New .ts files | Read: docs/CONVENTIONS.md |
```

If no docs exist yet, generate stub documentation files with TODO placeholders during scaffolding.

## MEMORY.md Seeding

Seed the project's MEMORY.md with initial lessons from the detected stack. MEMORY.md is auto-loaded into every Claude Code system prompt, creating a self-improvement loop.

### Location
```
~/.claude/projects/<project-path-with-dashes>/memory/MEMORY.md
```

Where `<project-path-with-dashes>` is the absolute project path with `/` replaced by `-` (e.g., `-Users-dev-myproject`).

### What to Seed
1. **Stack details** — language version, build tool, package manager
2. **Architecture patterns** — module structure discovered during detection
3. **Common pitfalls** for the detected stack:
   - TypeScript: ESM import extensions, `tsconfig` strictness, type-only imports
   - Python: virtual env activation, `__init__.py` requirements, type checking with mypy
   - Rust: borrow checker common mistakes, feature flags, workspace patterns
   - Go: module paths, exported vs unexported, error wrapping
4. **Testing patterns** — framework, mock strategy, test file locations
5. **Owner preferences** — any conventions the user specified during `/init`

### Size Budget
Keep under 55 lines initially — leave room for growth as the agent learns during sessions. The 200-line system prompt limit applies to MEMORY.md too.

## Directory Structure Creation

Create the following structure:

```
.claude/
├── commands/
│   └── parallel.md            ← multi-session coordination guide
├── reports/
│   ├── _registry.md          ← from session-management references
│   ├── _tech-debt.md         ← from session-management references
│   ├── architecture/
│   ├── bugs/
│   ├── code-review/
│   ├── config/
│   ├── dependencies/
│   ├── docs/
│   ├── features/
│   ├── integration/
│   ├── performance/
│   ├── refactor/
│   ├── security/
│   ├── testing/
│   ├── ci/
│   ├── tech-debt/
│   └── release/
└── scripts/
    └── post-edit-check.sh     ← from quality-gates hook
```

### Steps
1. Create all 15 category directories under `.claude/reports/`
2. Copy `registry-template.md` content to `.claude/reports/_registry.md` (empty, ready to use)
3. Copy `tech-debt-template.md` content to `.claude/reports/_tech-debt.md` (empty, ready to use)
4. Copy `post-edit-check.sh` to `.claude/scripts/` using `cp` via Bash (NOT the Write tool — Write can corrupt line endings and break the script):
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .claude/scripts && cp "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DIR/scripts/post-edit-check.sh" .claude/scripts/post-edit-check.sh && chmod +x .claude/scripts/post-edit-check.sh
   ```
   If `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DIR` is unavailable, locate the plugin via `find ~/.claude -name "post-edit-check.sh" | head -1` and cp from there.
5. Create `.claude/commands/parallel.md` with project-specific file ownership boundaries
6. Seed MEMORY.md at the auto-memory path (see MEMORY.md Seeding section above)

## Hook Setup

Based on detected stack, wire up the PostToolUse hook:

1. Create or update `.claude/settings.json` with **exactly** this content (no extra arguments, no modifications):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash .claude/scripts/post-edit-check.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Important:** The command must be exactly `bash .claude/scripts/post-edit-check.sh` — do not add arguments like `$CLAUDE_TOOL_INPUT_FILE_PATH`. The script reads `$CLAUDE_TOOL_INPUT` from the environment automatically.

2. Do NOT modify the script — it already handles all stacks (TypeScript, Python, Rust, Go) via file extension detection. Copy it verbatim.

## Interactive Flow

When running the scaffolding, interact with the user for decisions:

### Step 1: Detect and Confirm
```
Detected stack: TypeScript (package.json + tsconfig.json)
Build: npm run build
Test: npm test
Lint: npm run lint

Does this look correct? Any changes?
```

### Step 2: Custom Conventions
```
Any project-specific conventions I should add to CLAUDE.md?
For example:
- Specific directory structure rules
- Required code patterns
- Forbidden patterns or anti-patterns
```

### Step 3: Generate and Review
1. Generate `CLAUDE.md` with all detected + user-provided info
2. Create `.claude/` directory structure
3. Set up hooks
4. Show summary of what was created

### Step 4: Confirm
```
Created:
- CLAUDE.md (project configuration with Triggers, under 200 lines)
- .claude/reports/ (15 category dirs + registry + tech debt tracker)
- .claude/commands/parallel.md (multi-session coordination)
- .claude/scripts/post-edit-check.sh (auto-validation hook)
- .claude/settings.json (PostToolUse hook wired up)
- MEMORY.md (seeded at ~/.claude/projects/.../memory/MEMORY.md)

Ready to start developing with session tracking, auto-validation,
and self-improvement across sessions.
```
